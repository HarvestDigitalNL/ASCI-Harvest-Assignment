# ASCI-Harvest
ASCI &amp; Harvest Digital - TypeScript challenge.

## The Goal

We want to send some messages to our customers! To do so, we have two data sources:

1. A batch of messages, which contains the selected template (see '2') and customer-specific information.
2. A message template, which contains information about the message we want to send in several languages.

All source code is included in the `src` folder, which contains some base code and several TODO's to help you get 
started. You can ignore the files outside the `src` folder, but feel free to ask or take a look if you are interested 
in their purpose.

**Before you start developing, please follow the requirements below.**

The first team that successfully sends an SMS message to one of their phones wins! :-)
